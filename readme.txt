           Electric Driverless Smart Car 

 Problem Statement:
Is it possible to drive a car without driver?
Is the car being automatic?
  
Objective:
We, in our project try to build circuit for making our car as smart as possible 
Enter co-ordinate and reach destination
Outside â€“ inside temperature controller
Smart doors and many such things


  

                                   Function of Our Project
         Smart Car who senses outdoor temp and displays it on Lcd screen.



A smoke sensor to detect the release of flammable gas and if it is detected then then alarm gets turned on and doors get open for passenger safety.


Two headlight which are automatically controlled by light intensity in surrounding 

Ensures the user safety if the car collides or certain amount force is inserted and then it opens the air bag and print the message on the screen


Give location coordinates and it automatically reached at destination 
Servo motor works like a steering and it move to according to coordinates given by user 

 









                                          Components  Used 

1.	2 Arduino 





2.	2 Servo Motor acting as 2 Gate


3.	1 lcd
 
4.	1 piezo buzzer
 


5.force sensor
 
5.	Gas sensor

  
6.	Photo resistor
  
7.	Temperature sensor (TMP36)

 






8.	1 Resistor (1 k ohms)


 
9.	2 Bulb
 

10.	1 potentiometer
 
11.	1 Ultra - Sonic Sensor



                                               Detailed Working
If the value of intensity becomes greater than certain threshold, then the head light switch off and when becomes lesser they get switched on.
The gas sensor detects the fire by identifying the amount of propane and carbon di oxide present in surrounding if it gets above certain threshold which in of case is 200ppm then it alerts before the situation get dangerous by printing on lcd a certain message and turning on the buzzer and by opening the two doors for user safety.
It even ensures the user safety if the car collides, or certain amount force is inserted and then it opens the air bag and print the message on the screen.
It even detect the surrounding temperature and display it on Lcd screen.

It detects the objects in its path with the help of Ultra sonic sensor . After detecting object in it's range it blows horn means piezo buzzer and work accordingly.
